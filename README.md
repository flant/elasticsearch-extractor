**elasticsearch-extractor** is a simple web UI for end users to extract any index from the desired Elasticsearch snapshot within repository (S3-compatible or any other registered in your cluster).

It requires Elasticsearch v7.0 or greater.

# Motivation / idea

*[This announcement](https://blog.flant.com/announcing-elasticsearch-extractor-open-source-tool/) of the project (Jan'21) sheds some light on why elasticsearch-extractor has emerged.*

We deal with lots of logs stored in Elasticsearch clusters. They are regularly archived into snapshots and stored in S3. Being available in snapshots for a long period, these logs are quite often needed by engineers (to be examined for different reasons). That's why we want to have a simple interface for getting these logs from snapshots.

While we really like [Cerebro](https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro/), it gives you *too much* power over Elasticsearch clusters and doesn't allow you to control permissions for its users. Here's how we've ended up with creating a much simpler tool that implements the only function: to extract an index from Elasticsearch snapshot.

elasticsearch-extractor operates as:
* a simple web UI for end users;
* a server proxying requests to Elasticsearch.

Since there's no authentication layer implemented in elasticsearch-extractor, you have to use your relevant infrastructure components for that, e.g. Ingress controller (if Elasticsearch is in Kubernetes) or nginx/Apache built-in capabilities.

# Using

## Installing & running in Linux with systemd

To build & install elasticsearch-extractor on Linux (with systemd), please use the following commands:

```
$ go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...
$ git clone https://github.com/flant/elasticsearch-extractor.git
$ cd elasticsearch-extractor
$ make
$ sudo cp ./build/elasticsearch-extractor /usr/local/sbin/extractor
$ sudo cp ./examples/main.yml /usr/local/etc/extractor.yml
$ sudo cp ./examples/extractor.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ vim /usr/local/etc/extractor.yml # config is small and self-descriptive
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl start extractor
$ sudo systemctl enable extractor
```

## Hot reload
Use `air`:
```bash
$ go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
$ air

```

## Running in Docker

```
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate -d
```
